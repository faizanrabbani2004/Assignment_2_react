                                    <p>Recently, the US Federal government banned online casinos from operating in America by
                                        making it illegal to transfer money to them through any US bank or payment system. As a
                                        result of this law, most of the popular online casino networks such as Party Gaming and
                                        PlayTech left the United States. Overnight, online casino players found themselves being
                                        chased by the Federal government. But, after a fortnight, the online casino industry
                                        came up with a solution and new online casinos started taking root. These began to
                                        operate under a different business umbrella, and by doing that, rendered the transfer of
                                        money to and from them legal. A major part of this was enlisting electronic banking
                                        systems that would accept this new clarification and start doing business with me.
